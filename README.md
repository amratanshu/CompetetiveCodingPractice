COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBLIME using custom build - 

input file- inputf.in
output file- outputf.in

FOR SUBLIME BUILD NAMED AS "cppbuild1". I've already added this build in the sublime build options/ It is ready to use for compiling and running cpp files. 

//code if from a GITHUB Repository.

TO COMPILE ANY FILE - 

CTRL+B - This process is using the file inputf.in as stdin file and outputf.in as stdout file. You should open both these files when you're coding xD. Type and save your input in your input file. 

CTRL + shift + B - RUN. This saves the output in outputf.in. Check it by opening it in a different tab/Layout window.
